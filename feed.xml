                <blockquote>
<p>So, you are on your way home? When I was at your age, I never went home until eight o'clock!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was only five o'clock when the white-haired professor lectured us in the elevator heading down to the entrance floor of the building at the University of Washington where I did my postdoc. Since then, countless researchers at various universities have answered my opening line, "How are you doing?" with the contagious, "There's too much going on now," before continuing with the jargon that long stressful work days are the only way forward.<br><br>Are never-ending work days the cost of freedom at work? Is it even beneficial for the research?<br><br>Indeed, it is possible to accomplish miracles during long stressful days at work, but many times, "There's too much going on now," is more about self-fraud in the absence of miracles. Once upon a time, long days were the means to achieve great accomplishments, but suddenly long days and stress became goals in themselves. It is so much easier to succeed in that way: Everyone can rise to the status of hero by dragging around in the bog of stress.<br><br>In elite sports, it is called overtraining and gives no status, because everyone knows that overtraining prevents results. With measurable goals it becomes apparent. The training culture that only counts hours does not breed stars. And as little as more miles will pay off for the training addict, will late evenings after already long days at work automatically lead to more research breakthroughs. The perceived security from doing more of the same is a red herring.<br><br>Of course, the solution is the cliché of balance and variation. Rationally, we know that training breaks down and recovery rebuilds, that long workouts must be followed by short workouts, hard workouts by easy, and that rest days are supercompensation days. But when the duty calls from oneself, colleagues, and funding agencies, it feels good to do a couple of extra hours despite muddy thoughts. "Everybody else does it." With duty before all, the collective march continues with heavy steps – at worst in circles.<br><br>The real challenge is to have the courage to break habits and inspire change. The hard thing comes first – to change oneself. It is hardly possible without actionable goals toward the answers to what we truly want to achieve. After that, everything is about never looking away from the goal and about inspiring others to joyful work toward new heights. There are many techniques to get there. Speaking for myself, I try to run with relaxed form and look naturally ahead to avoid cramping and maintain focus.<br>Moreover, there is nothing that beats power naps to keep the stress away and the thoughts clear. And if you ask how I am doing, then I hope I will use <a href="http://www.umu.se/sok/personalkatalog?languageId=3&amp;uid=fral0001">Fredrik Almqvist</a>'s reply: "Pretty darn well!" It is also contagious.</p>

<p>Zoogeographical regions, or zooregions, are areas of the Earth defined by species pools that reflect ecological, historical and evolutionary processes acting over millions of years. Consequently, researchers have assumed that zooregions are robust and unlikely to change on a human timescale. However, the increasing number of human‐mediated introductions and extinctions can challenge this assumption. By delineating zooregions with a network‐based algorithm, here we show that introductions and extinctions are altering the zooregions we know today. Introductions are homogenising the Eurasian and African mammal zooregions and also triggering less intuitive effects in birds and amphibians, such as dividing and redefining zooregions representing the Old and New World. Furthermore, these Old and New World amphibian zooregions are no longer detected when considering introductions plus extinctions of the most threatened species. Our findings highlight the profound and far‐reaching impact of human activity and call for identifying and protecting the uniqueness of biotic assemblages.</p>

                <p>I was born in Uppsala and grew up north of Umeå. At 16, I went to a high school for cross-country skiing in Lycksele before my undergraduate in engineering physics. After my Ph.D. in network science at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, I moved to the Department of Biology at the University of Washington in Seattle for my postdoc. There I started working on a grand challenge in network science: how to simplify and highlight essential regularities in networks into maps. Mapping networks is a holy grail of data science because in the myriad links and nodes of a network hide answers to how we can predict how the system will evolve.</p>
<p>From 2009 at Umeå University, and since 2019 as a professor in physics with focus on computational science, I have continued to develop and integrate new math, algorithms, and visualizations into powerful mapping tools for efficiently going from interaction data to insightful maps, new hypotheses, and unexpected discoveries. With a diverse research group in <a href="https://icelab.se" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Icelab</a> and a growing collaboration network, our applications now extend across both the natural and social sciences.</p>
<p>As a professional power napper, my favorite place in IceLab after lunch is a hidden couch.</p>
<p>I am fortunate to live between the university and the ski trails with my wife Marie and our two daughters born in 2014 and 2018. When I am not in a playground with my daughters, you will find me increasing my dopamine levels on cross-country skis.</p>
<p>In 2014, I received the Nordea Science Prize and in 2018 the Young Scientist Award for Socio- and Econophysics.</p>
<p>My research is funded by the Swedish Research Council, the Olle Engkvist Byggmästare Foundation, and the Carl Trygger Foundation. </p>

                As a young disoriented PhD student, I was invited to an interdisciplinary workshop in the outskirts of the Fontainebleau forest south of Paris. It became a defining moment for me as a researcher. I came there as a student who knew how to answer questions, following well-established recipes. After a week with French Master's students from different disciplines, doing nothing but asking questions and juggling ideas, I left as an explorer into the unknown guided by research questions.<br><br>While I have been lost many times also after the workshop, I never lost the inner compass and the excitement for the unknown. Instead I decided that one day, when I have support to organize a similar workshop, I will pay back to the scientific community and organize a similar workshop. Today I am coming back from my seventh, hoping that some of the more than one hundred Master's students, PhD students, and Postdocs who have participated over the years still can fuel themselves with memories from the many magical aha! moments I have witnessed. <br><br><a href="https://icelab.se/event/icelab-camp-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IceLab Camp</a> is about all that coffee break wisdom that it can take years to collect. Equipped only with their curiosity and creativity, the participants let ideas meet and mate to carve out interdisciplinary research proposals. It is a four day long tour de force into the unknown, accompanied by the beauty that autumn days in Northern Sweden can offer, to achieve researcher's high.<br>
<blockquote>Oh, well. What's an interdisciplinary workshop? After all, I suppose it would be frightfully dull, and-and-and boring, and-and completely... Completely wonderful.</blockquote>
<em>In the Professor Magenta podcast episode <a href="https://soundcloud.com/professormagenta/research-remix-cut" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PM SPECIAL – Är framtidens forskning den gränslösa</a> (10 minutes), one of the participants, Katarina Bendtz from Stockholm University, interviews three other participants from the workshop. Akbar Espaillat, Mariana Mariana Buongermino Pereira, and Ulf Aslak Jensen give a brief introduction to their PhD projects and explain how their research combines methods from different disciplines in a productive way. The students are affiliated with MIMS, Umeå University, Chalmers University of Technology and Copenhagen University, respectively.</em>

                <p><strong>Martin Rosvall</strong> and <strong>Carl T. Bergstrom</strong></p>
<p>Change is a fundamental ingredient of interaction patterns in biology, technology, the economy, and science itself: Interactions within and between organisms change; transportation patterns by air, land, and sea all change; the global financial flow changes; and the frontiers of scientific research change. Networks and clustering methods have become important tools to comprehend instances of these large-scale structures, but without methods to distinguish between real trends and noisy data, these approaches are not useful for studying how networks change. Only if we can assign significance to the partitioning of single networks can we distinguish meaningful structural changes from random fluctuations. Here we show that bootstrap resampling accompanied by significance clustering provides a solution to this problem. To connect changing structures with the changing function of networks, we highlight and summarize the significant structural changes with alluvial diagrams and realize de Solla Price's vision of mapping change in science: studying the citation pattern between about 7000 scientific journals over the past decade, we find that neuroscience has transformed from an interdisciplinary specialty to a mature and stand-alone discipline.</p>

                <p><strong>Martin Rosvall</strong> and <strong>Carl T. Bergstrom</strong></p>
<p>To comprehend the multipartite organization of large-scale biological and social systems, we introduce a new information-theoretic approach to reveal community structure in weighted and directed networks. The method decomposes a network into modules by optimally compressing a description of information flows on the network. The result is a map that both simplifies and highlights the regularities in the structure and their relationships to each other. We illustrate the method by making a map of scientific communication as captured in the citation patterns of more than 6000 journals. We discover a multicentric organization with fields that vary dramatically in size and degree of integration into the network of science. Along the backbone of the network — which includes physics, chemistry, molecular biology, and medicine — information flows bidirectionally, but the map reveals a directional pattern of citation from the applied fields to the basic sciences.</p>
